# Functional-Programming
This project involves implementing a set of utility functions in Lisp that operate on lists, sets, and mathematical computations. The project is divided into three main categories, each with a specific focus and set of functions:

1. **List Functions:**
   - Implements basic list manipulations such as counting elements, removing specific elements, applying functions to list elements, and merging sorted lists.
   - Examples: ```.LENGTH```, ```.REMOVE-ALL```, ```.MAP```, and ```.MERGE```.
2. **Set Functions:**
   - Provides operations to check membership, insert elements, find differences, and verify subset relationships within sets.
   - Examples: ```.ELEMENT-OF```, ```.INSERT```, ```.DIFFERENCE```, and ```.SUPERSETEQ```.
3. **Math Functions:**
   - Includes functions for computing factorials, checking right triangles, calculating Fibonacci numbers, and computing powers.
   - Examples: ```.FACTORIAL```, ```.RIGHT-TRI```, ```.NTH-FIBO```, and ```.POW```.
  
Each function is implemented with recursion and functional programming practices, avoiding loops or variable reassignment. The project showcases Lisp's capabilities in handling recursive operations, list processing, and functional paradigms.
